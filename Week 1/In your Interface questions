4. The interface should only contain what the user needs to know, like looking at the face of a watch or the workings of a mobile app.
Implementation is everything else that the user doesn’t need to know, the inner workings, like the gears behind the watch face that keep 
track of time and move the watch arms, or the data and code used to make the app work. 

5. Design the interface to select a generic “storage device” button or option and file to save. 
Then implement each storage device type with its method for saving under a class. As future storage types are created, 
you can add the future storage device method to the class without changing the interface.
